# Topic: Construction

## My Contribution to the team:
- [X] We worked using a git repository that I created. Using git gave us the hability to practice even more how to use the tool
- [X] I started working on the json file, transforming the data to the xml file.
- [X] This part of transforming from json to xml was hard working, because some elements I had to write again (ex. each worker inside workers, each equipment inside equipments and each material inside supplies)
- [X] Oluwole worked on the DTD, XSL and XSLT. I helped to validate using the online tool and to correct some errors before we got the validation without errors
- [X] Since we both wanted to have the experience to work on the HTML and JavaScript, we decided to work on two HTMLs. I worked on the displayConstruction2. To access the folder [ClickHere](/displayConstruction2/)
- [X] I worked with three different files while working with the visualization. I worked with the [HTML](/displayConstruction2/displayConstruction2.html), the [CSS](/displayConstruction2/style.css) and with the [JavaScript](/displayConstruction2/script.js)
- [X] To see how the visualization ended up [ClickHere](displayConstruction2.png)
- [X] Working with the HTML was very chaleging this time, because the idea was to display the workers, equipments and supply inside of different tables. It was challenging, but I could learn a lot.
